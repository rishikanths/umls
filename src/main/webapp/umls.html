					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						UMLS stands for <b>U</b>nified <b>M</b>edical <b>L</b>anguage <b>S</b>ystems.
						The project is developed and maintained by National Library of
						Medicine. Before UMLS, the biomedical community had diverse
						medical terminologies that captured the domain's vocabulary. For
						example, <span id='termInfo'>ICD (International
							Classification of Diseases)</span>, <span id='termInfo'>MeSH(Medical
							Subject Heading)</span>, <span id='termInfo'>SNOMED-CT
							(Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine- Clinical Terms)</span>,<span
							id='termInfo'>OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)</span>
						and many other terminologies, both national and
						international.However, all these terminologies are <b><i>disparate</i></b>
						and <i><b>not interoperable </b></i>, i.e., they don't talk or
						understand each other. This has unintended effect on biomedical
						software applications as various applications use different
						terminologies. Now, the applications cannot communicate data among
						themselves, even though all the applications have ONE goal -
						patient care.
					</p>
					<p>
						The UMLS project was initiated in 1986 to integrate various
						disparate biomedical terminologies and provide a unified global
						terminology. It provides a mapping structure among these diverse
						terminologies allowing one (human or software)to translate
						concepts among the various terminologies. Thus using UMLS, a
						biomedical application using <span id='termInfo'>SNOMED-CT</span>
						can understand another software application using <span
							id='termInfo'> ICD terminology</span>. For over more than 30
						years, the UMLS system has integrated more than 60 families of
						biomedical terminologies. Currently, UMLS holds 2.5 million
						concepts or terms and over 12 million relations among these
						concepts. Its scope is broader and its granularity finer than that
						of any of its source vocabularies. <br /> <br />

					<h2>UMLS System</h2>
					<p>
						UMLS is comprised of three components: <span id='termInfo'><b>Metathesaurus</b>,
							<b>Semantic Networks</b></span> and <span id='termInfo'><b>SPECIALIST
								Lexicon</b></span>.
					<div id="meta">
						<ul>
							<li>The <span id='termInfo'>Metathesaurus</span> forms the
								base of the UMLS and holds all the concepts and relationships.
								In simple terms, its a database which stores all the concepts
								and respective information. <br />The <span id='termInfo'>Metathesaurus</span>
								is organized by concept, and each concept has attributes
								defining its meaning and is linked to the corresponding concept
								names in the various source vocabularies. As different
								terminologies may use different names for the same concept
								(Heart Attack or Cardiac Arrest), then a common agreed term will
								be faithfully represented in the <span id='termInfo'>Metathesaurus</span>
								to connect all the synonyms. <span id='termInfo'>Metathesaurus</span>
								concepts can also link to resources outside of the database, for
								instance gene sequence databases.
							</li>
							<li>The <span id='termInfo'>Semantic Network (SN)</span> is
								structure formed by semantic types that are connected using
								semantic relationships. Semantic types can be considered as a
								set of broad subject categories that are used for categorizing
								the concepts stored in the Metathesaurus. For example, the terms
								<span id='termInfo'>Fever, Cardiac Arrest and Malaria</span> are
								of type (or belong to category) <span id='termInfo'>'Disease
									or Syndrome'</span>. <br /> Each concept in the <span id='termInfo'>Metathesaurus</span>
								is assigned one or more semantic types. For example, <span
								id='termInfo'>Fever</span> is of semantic type (can be
								categorized as) <span id='termInfo'>'Disease or
									Syndrome', 'Sign or Symptom'</span>, and <span id='termInfo'>'Finding'</span>.
								The semantic types are linked with to one another through
								semantic relationships. <br />UMLS rather has broad
								classification; there are <b>135 semantic types</b> and <b>54
									relationships</b>. The major semantic types are organisms,
								anatomical structures, biologic function, chemicals, events,
								physical objects, and concepts or ideas. The primary link
								between semantic types is the "isa" link, establishing a
								hierarchy of types. The network also has 5 major categories of
								non-hierarchical (or associative) relationships, which
								constitute the remaining 53 relationship types. These are
								"physically related to", "spatially related to", "temporally
								related to", "functionally related to" and "conceptually related
								to".
